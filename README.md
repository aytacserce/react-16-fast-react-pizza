21.09.2023

---

This is a pizza ordering app project built with React with following functionality and key concepts:
- We can;
  - enter name, phone number and adress for pizza delivery,
  - view a menu and add pizzas to the card directly, change their amounts or remove them,
  - use cart page also to change amounts or delete pizzas, check overall price,
  - select order type as "priority" for an extra price,
  - place order using geolocation and reverse positioning,
  - track our order status with a unique order ID.
- In this project; conditional rendering, geolocation, react router and especially redux and tailwind CSS were practiced.
